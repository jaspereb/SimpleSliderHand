The goal of dynamixel calibration is to have the open and close positions be accurate. The startup position should be set to 'open' as well.

To do this the settings in the hand software are defined.

-Multi turn mode. This can be checked by setting the resolution divider and checking if this has an effect
-Resolution divider = 1
-ID = 1
-Defaults, but can be changed:
    -Torque = 500
    -Speed = 1023
    

1. Detach hand tendons and drive dynamixel to zero position
2. Ensure resolution divider is applied then drive to 500
3. Move cars to closed position, attach tendons in direction that allows the 500 offset to be reduced in order to tighten them
4. Attach opening tendons and remove slack from system
5. Drive dynamixels to completely close gripper
6. Record and set 'closed' position
7. Drive dynamixels to fully open position
8. Record and set 'open' position




Absolute Encoder Testing:
-Power cycling the board when the position is non zero has no effect
-When the motor power was disconnected with the control board still powered, it altered the zero position
-When it was moved while unpowered this had an effect
-Repeated this again and it had no effect? 

Notes:
-Firmware v39 or above req for multi turn mode, don't look at the protocol 1.0 docs
-Max 360d in normal mode, could be an issue
-Need position sensing in wheel mode though?
